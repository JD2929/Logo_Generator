# Logo_Generator

## Purpose
This is a quick and easy way to generate a logo for someone looking to start out on their own business adventure. 

## Use

In the command line type:

node index.js 

You will then be prompted to enter the 3 characters you want to show up on your logo. You are are kept to 3 characters and asked to fix it before going on. As well you are reminded that what you type will be what you see. So if you want all capitals use uppercase to type it in. 

Then you are asked for the text colour. You can enter it as a CSS keyword colour or as a hexidecimal colour beginning with the #. 

Your next prompt allows you to choose between circle, square or triangle for the backdrop of the logo. Simply arrow through to the one you would like. 

Last but not least you are once again asked for a colour, but this time for the shape. Again you can use a CSS keyword colour or as a hexidecimal colour beginning with the #. 

## Credits

An addition pacakge from npm was added that allowed the max length to be easily kept to 3 for the characters portion of the prompts. 

An additional set of instructions was added to the package.json file to be able to use import and export instead of "require" throughout the code. 

## Screen shots 

The following screen shots are first the prompt questions being answered. The second is the output of those prompts.
